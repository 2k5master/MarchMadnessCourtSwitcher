Welcome to the March Madness Legacy Court Switcher by 2k5master!

To use this, simply place the exe as well as the neccesary bat files and the stadiums folder in your stadium directory (data/gfx/sceneassets/fxsimple/stadium). And then, before you play a tournament game, simply check the stadium in "Arena Select" and enable the neccesary court in the court switcher.

If you are curious about the code, I attached the .py file. You may use it for your own personal projects and/or borrow code from it. The same goes for the .bat files. However, unlike the .py file, the .bat files are neccesary and needed to run the program.

If you have an comments/questions, feel free to dm me on discord. Enjoy!

FOR TROUBLESHOOTING PURPOSES:
Enable the Reset option, and then trash your stadiums folder. Then, download the stadiums folder again from here.
