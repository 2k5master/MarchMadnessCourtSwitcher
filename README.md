Welcome to the March Madness Legacy Court Switcher! 

To use this, simply place the file as well as the neccesary bat files in your stadium directory (data/gfx/sceneassets/fxsimple/stadium). And then, before you play a tournament game, simply check the stadium in "Arena Select" and enable the neccesary court in the court switcher.

FOR TROUBLESHOOTING PURPOSES:
Enable the Reset option, and then trash your stadiums folder. Then, download the stadiums folder again from here.
